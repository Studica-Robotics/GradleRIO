After building the artifact, the artifact must be deployed to the Gradle Plugin site (https://plugins.gradle.org/).  The specific URL at which the plugin is deployed is as follows:

Audience	URL

FIRST			https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.kauailabs.first.GradleRIO
WorldSkills	https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.kauailabs.wsr.GradleRIO

To publish, after ensuring a new unique version number is in the build.gradle file, invoke the following command from the <gradlerio_github_repo_root>:

gradlew publishPlugins

After publication, itâ€™s recommended to verify that the new GradleRIO plugin version is successfully published to the Gradle Plugin site.
